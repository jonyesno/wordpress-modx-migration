Quick'n'dirty scripts to migrate blog content from Wordpress to ModX.

FILES

* config.rb     - db connection details
* wordpress.rb - Wordpress class to discover posts, categories, comments
* modx         - similar for ModX, also creates new posts, categories, comments
* migration.rb - uses Wordpress and ModX classes to migrate the data
* migrate.rb   - trivial wrapper

USAGE

$ ./migrate.rb

NOTES

The migration recreates posts and comments every time it is run, but it
won't touch content already in ModX, so it can be repeatedly run to keep
the two sites in sync during a migration period.

During the migration we try to re-encode content in UTF-8 as required.

Wordpress comments have no subject, but ModX ones do. The ModX comments
mappings need some additional work.

ModX categories (tags) - are denormalised into a per-post array.

THANKS

Thanks to Matthew Killock for letting me use his PHP script to guide
the Wordpress -> ModX mappings.
